    <p class="about">
      A majority of immigrants are left homeless and without housing assistance.
      Many have nowhere to go and are left on the streets to fend for themselves
      and their children. Hope Sanctuary provides affordable housing for immigrants
      and refugees by offering a safe and comfortable environment with volunteer
      host families. We transfer them from other unsafe facilities and provide them with 
      the utmost care.
